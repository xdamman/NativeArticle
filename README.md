# NativeArticle
Twitter bot that tweets a screenshot of the articles shared by the Twitter accounts it follows.

Follow [@NativeArticle](https://twitter.com/NativeArticle).

## Why?
The mobile website of most publishers out there require you to load more than 2.5MB of data and perform 100+ requests to various servers just to load one article page. As a result, if you are on a 3G connection, [it may take up to 46s to load that page](http://xdamman.com/website-optimization-grunt-uncss). Insane. Especially if you are traveling (as I am) and you need to watch your roaming data consumption.

This bot will automatically tweet two screenshots of the mobile version so that you can have a preview that loads instantly in your Twitter feed for only 80KB per screenshot.
